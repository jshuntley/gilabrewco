          Our brewing journey began with a simple Northern Brewer beginner
          kit—just plastic buckets, extracts, and a five-gallon brew kettle.
          Like many passionate brewers, what started as a hobby quickly became
          an obsession. Though our enthusiasm grew, our limited space and aging
          equipment held us back. Now, years later, we've expanded our workspace
          and invested in a three-vessel, all-grain setup from SS Brewtech.
          Let's see what we can do with it!

            Our brewing process is a journey, an adventure that combines the
            time-honored traditions of all-grain brewing with the precision of
            modern technology. We're set up with a three-vessel, 10-gallon SS
            Brewtech e-brewing system, giving us the ability to control every
            detail and ensure consistency in our brews.

          >
            Right now, we're deeply focused on learning different beer styles
            and digging into the basics. Mistakes? Totally part of the process!
            We welcome them as they teach us and push us to become better. By
            being open to experimentation and the occasional slip-up, we're not
            just brewing beer—we're crafting an art form.
